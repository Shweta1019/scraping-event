The task is to create a web page that lists all events in Sydney, Australia, scraping data automatically from event websites, and displaying them beautifully with details. Each event should have a “GET TICKETS” button that when clicked, takes the user's email with consent before redirecting to the original event site. The listing should update automatically as new events are published.
Scraping event data from event websites.
Since backend code is not requested by default, but scraping requires server-side or proxy usage, I will implement a frontend-only approach.

Plan:

Create a single HTML file with external CSS and JS.
In JS, fetch event data (simulated or from an open API) for Sydney events.
Display events in cards with image, title, date/time, venue, and "GET TICKETS" button.
On button click, show a modal for email input with opt-in checkbox.
On confirmation, redirect to event URL.
Refresh event list periodically (every 10 minutes).
Challenges in scraping (CORS, anti-scraping measures, dynamic content)
Method for automatic updates (cron jobs, serverless scraping)
Improvements (email validation, event filters, backend friendlier solution)
